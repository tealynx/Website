## Agree on the purpose of the web site

The website will offer prospective visitors to the theme park (children, teenagers, or their parents) with an attractive overview of what they might find at the theme park. The website will feature stats such as the altitude of some of the highest rides and showcase videos to give prospective visitors with an inside look into the theme park before they visit.

## Research theme park websites

- https://www.canadaswonderland.com/
- https://www.sixflags.com/
- https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/
- https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_CA/
- https://www.europapark.de/en

## Observations:
- They all provide quick call-to-actions (CTAs) for those looking to either Buy Tickets or Learn More
- When the visitor is looking to learn more about the theme park, they are offered with options that better guide them to the right category of rides based on their demographics, interests, level of expertise with theme parks (i.e., Big Thrills, Kids' Area, waterparks, etc) 
- Display events taking place at the theme park such as plays and concerts
- Information is organized in an easy to view manner, where the main titles are displayed at the top of the page to allow users to navigate through the information effortlessly
- The font for https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/ is distracting. There is too much going on the page and too many popups. 
- https://www.europapark.de/en uses a captivating video on the opening page to captivate the user. This is an excellent technique to captivate the user and looks streamlined and professional

## Agree on the content for the web site
- Since the aim is to design the website within three pages, we will have the following pages for the website: Home, Rides, and Buy Ticket
- The information about our theme park will be easy to access and will use a font that is professional and sleek
- We will also display information about the restaurants and different kiosks that will be at our theme park
- We will provide a map of the park with the relevant medical sites and other useful information shown (ATMs, bathrooms and attractions)
- Our theme park will focus more on mechanical roller coasters and dry land activities rather than water themed rides

## Agree on the structure of the website
- The Home page will contain a breadth of information and a high-level overview of the different types of rides available, the additional services offered such as medical assistance, food, and safety, events, and finally call-to-actions directing the visitor to purchase a ticket.
- The Rides page will contain detailed information on the top rides at the theme park. Four rides will be displayed on one screen and filtering tools will be available to the visitor. They will have to press See More to load more rides.
- The Buy Ticket page will contain pricing information and allow the visitor to select how many tickets for what age groups they would like to purchase. They will also have the option of adding additional services to their checkout basket, as well as special promotions or seasonal passes.
